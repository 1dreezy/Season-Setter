## ☀️ **Season-Setter** ❄️ 
*A SA-MP mod that lets you switch between summer and winter seasons!*

---

### **Description**
**Season-Setter** is a Lua script for **GTA San Andreas MP**, created using **MoonLoader**. This mod allows you to toggle between two seasons: **summer** 🌞 and **winter** ❄️, each with unique preview images and configurations. 
- The mod is a bit more complex to set up compared to simple drag & drop installations.  
You’ll need to create two folders in **ModLoader** named `Summer Edition` and `Winter Edition`.  
(These names were chosen by me, but you can rename them if you want – the Lua script will handle access to the files regardless of the folder name.) 

- After that, you’ll also need to create two `.ini` files on GitHub, which act as toggles.  
- Switching one season **ON** will automatically set the other **OFF**, so only one is active at a time.  

### Supported file types for switching:
- `.txd`, `.dff`, `.ini`, `.cs`  
(⚠️ `.asi` files cannot be swapped this way.)  

Be mindful of the size of your mods – very large files can cause crashes, since GTA: San Andreas is still an old game with engine limitations.
